This file records the status of all packages needed by Sage, that means:

  - Where was the ebuild from ? New ? Science Overlay ? Portage ?
  - Differences to its original (if appropriate)
  - Is there a bugreport ?
  - Has it QA warnings ?
  - Has it tests, do they work ?

Packages:

- media-gfx/tachyon-0.98.7
  * Created bug #293969
  * Needs some testing, especially for USE=mpi and on other architectures

- sci-mathematics/ecm-6.2.3
  * Patches taken from bug #88093, updated ebuild to latest (6.2.3) version
  * USE=asm-redc : QA Notice: [..] text relocations
  * Reported back new ebuild and issues with USE=asm-redc on x86

- sci-libs/givaro-3.2.16
  * See bug #227803, givaro-3.2.13 + 3.3.0 are in science overlay
  * Tests fail

- sci-libs/linbox-1.1.6
  * See bug #227813, our ebuild supports more features
  * does not compile with givaro-3.3.0

- sci-libs/m4ri-20090512
  * See bug #230431, ebuild taken from science overlay
  * Support for additional configure options ?

- sci-libs/iml-1.0.3
  * See bug #230429
  * Everything seems fine

- sci-libs/libcliquer-1.2.2
  * No bugreport for cliquer
  * Treating Sage as upstream since they do not need binary but a shared object
  * QA Notice: [..] runtime text relocations
  * All tests successful

- sci-mathematics/palp-1.1
  * See bug #230441
  * Everything seems fine
  * Does not have tests

- sci-mathematics/ratpoints-2.1.3
  * No bugreport available
  * Tests fail

- sci-libs/cddlib-094f
  * See bug #230423
  * Compiles fine, no QA warnings, no tests

- sci-libs/zn_poly-0.9
  * No bugreport yet
  * Tests successful
  * Contains small hack for flint

- sci-libs/flint-1.5.0
  * See bug #230437
  * All tests successful

- sci-mathematics/flintqs-20070817_p4
  * No bugreport
  * Has no working homepage, svn or whatever
  * No tests
  * NO QA warnings

Problematic Packages:

- sci-mathematics/singular-3.1.0.7-r1
  * Needs customization: portage version does not build libsingular.so [done]
  * Sage's libsingular.h includes more headers, which contain function not
    available in newer versions

- sci-mathematics/sage-doc-4.2.1
  * Does not work. Documentation assumes sage-${PV}.spkg be compiled

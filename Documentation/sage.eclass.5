.SH "NAME"
sage.eclass \- Tools to ease the compilation of Sage's spkg-packages and Sage itself
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The sage eclass serves two purposes:
Fistly, it eases the compilation of Sage itself by providing functions for
patching and modifying its *.spkg-files.

Secondly, in order to install packages from Sage's tarball it provides a
src_unpack function for automatic unpacking. You must set the following two
variables to make use of this:

.nf
SAGE_VERSION
SAGE_PACKAGE
.fi
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following is a minimal version of the flintqs ebuild and shows the usage
for packages included in Sage's tarball:

.nf
EAPI=2

SAGE_VERSION="4.2.1"
SAGE_PACKAGE="flintqs-20070817.p4"

inherit eutils sage

[..]

src_prepare() {
	cp "${SAGE_FILESDIR}"/lanczos.h .

	[..]
}

[..]
.fi
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.TP
\fBsage_clean_targets\fR [list of makefile targets to clean]
This function clears the prerequisites and commands for the specified targets
in Sage's deps-makefile. If one wants to use e.g. sqlite from portage, do the
following:

.nf
sage_clean_targets SQLITE
.fi

This modifies ${S}/spkg/standard/deps, which contains in sage-4.2.1 the
following lines:

.nf
$(INST)/$(SQLITE): $(INST)/$(TERMCAP) $(INST)/$(READLINE)
    $(SAGE_SPKG) $(SQLITE) 2>&1
.fi

The lines above will now be replaced with:

.nf
$(INST)/$(SQLITE):
    @echo "using SQLITE from portage"
.fi

so that ${S}/spkg/standard/deps is still a valid makefile but without building
sqlite.
.TP
\fBsage_package_patch\fR <spkg name> <patch name>
Executes 'epatch' inside the contents of a *.spkg-file. The spkg name must be
given without the trailing ".spkg".
.TP
\fBsage_package_sed\fR <spkg name> <arguments for sed>
Executes 'sed' inside the contents of a *.spkg-file. The spkg name must be
given without the trailing ".spkg".
.TP
\fBsage_package_cp\fR <spkg name> <arguments for cp>
Executes 'cp' inside the contents of a *.spkg-file. The spkg name must be
given without the trailing ".spkg".
.TP
\fBsage_package_finish\fR 
ATTENTION: This function must be executed if one of the
sage_package_*-functions was called. This cleans up and packs all unpacked
spkgs.
.TP
\fBsage_src_unpack\fR 
If SAGE_PACKAGE and SAGE_VERSION is set this function is exported. It will
unpack the specified spkg and also correctly set the source directory ('S')
and a variable SAGE_FILESDIR which points to the patches directory, if
available.

* Next packages marked for removal:

  - rubiks

* Decide what to do with:

  - sage_scripts
  - dsage
  - sagenb
  - examples

* Write a script that extracts the interesting parts of Sage's test.log (i.e.
  failing tests) and gathers the package names and versions that a provided by
  portage. This will simplify testing

* Disable Sage's update functionality. Portage should be used for that

Problematic Packages:

- sci-mathematics/singular-3.1.0.7-r1
  * Needs customization: portage version does not build libsingular.so [done]
  * Sage's libsingular.h includes more headers, which contain function not
    available in newer versions

- sci-mathematics/sage-doc-4.2.1
  * Does not work. Documentation assumes sage-${PV}.spkg be compiled

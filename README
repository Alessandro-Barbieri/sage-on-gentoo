sage-on-gentoo tries to provide a split ebuild(s) for the computer algebra
system SAGE (www.sagemath.org).

Since SAGE ships all of its dependencies (about 90 packages) this is a
difficult task and actually the reason why there is no SAGE in portage. I chose
to use GitHub so that everyone interested in can watch progress (RSS-Feed) and
test the ebuilds. I should note that I am not a official gentoo developer.

Quick Installation:

1. Setup a Portage Overlay:
   Create a overlay dir, e.g in your home directory and add to the
   PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in /etc/make.conf:

   <your-home-dir>/sage-on-gentoo

   Make sure to include the trailing 'sage-on-gentoo' (which does not yet
   exist but will be created by git).

2. Download the repository:
   Go to the overlay directory (if you are following the above example that will
   be your home directory) and type:

   git clone git://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo.git

   (which means you will need dev-util/git). This will create the sage-on-gentoo
   directory.

3. Test the ebuild:
   Type

   emerge -va sage

   to install sage; note that sci-libs/blas-atlas will take its time (on my pc
   about 4 hours). If you intend to test sage I _strongly recommend_ to use
   ccache (FEATURES=ccache, dev-util/ccache) which speeds up subsequent
   compilations.

4. Update repository:
   To update simply type:

   git pull

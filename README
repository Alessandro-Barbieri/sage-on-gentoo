sage-on-gentoo provides (experimental!) split ebuilds (www.gentoo.org) for the
computer algebra system SAGE (www.sagemath.org).

* Look at our wiki for documentation.

* If you find errors or have suggestions write a mail to the gentoo-science
  mailing list:

  or fork sage-on-gentoo and do it yourself!

INSTALLATION GUIDE AND SOME NOTES:

1. GET LAYMAN:
   The preferred method of getting sage-on-gentoo is layman. Make sure you have
   it installed and correctly configured. If not, you will find a guide here:

     http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml

2. ADD REPOSITORY:
   Update your layman list and add this repository with:

     layman -L
     layman -a sage-on-gentoo

3. UNMASK AND USE-FLAG PACKAGES:
   Before installing, you will need to unmask the required packages. A list of
   all required packages is located at:

     sage-on-gentoo/packages.keywords/sage

   Permanent unmasking can be done easily via placing a symbolic link in your
   /etc/portage/package.keywords directory, e.g.:

     ln -s /usr/local/portage/layman/sage-on-gentoo/package.keywords/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.keywords/sage

   Since the Sage ebuild requires its dependencies to be built with several USE-
   flags it is also a good idea to use the provided package.use file:

     ln -s /usr/local/portage/layman/sage-on-gentoo/package.use/sage \
           /etc/portage/package.use/sage

4. INSTALL SAGE:
   Type

     emerge -va sage

   to install sage; note that sci-libs/blas-atlas will take its time (on my pc
   about 4 hours). If you intend to test sage I _strongly recommend_ to use
   ccache (FEATURES=ccache, dev-util/ccache) which speeds up subsequent
   compilations.

5. UPDATE REPOSITORY:
   To update your local copy of sage-on-gentoo simply type:

     layman -S

   WARNING: We apply patches and make changes to Sage's ebuild (which holds true
   only for sci-mathematics/sage) without updating its name (e.g. adding a
   revision suffix "-rX") to make ccache work.
   For this reason you will need to _manually_ re-emerge sci-mathematics/sage
   after updating the overlay - if you want to use our latest changes.

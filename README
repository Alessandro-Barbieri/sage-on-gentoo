sage-on-gentoo tries to provide a split ebuild(s) for the computer algebra
system SAGE (www.sagemath.org). Since SAGE ships all of its dependencies (about
90 packages!) this is a difficult task and actually the reason why there is no
SAGE in portage.

Internal documenation (sage.eclass manpage for example) can be found in the
Documentation/ subdirectory.

If you find errors, have suggestions report contact me via:

or fork sage-on-gentoo and do it yourself!

Quick Installation:

1. Setup a Portage Overlay:
   Create a overlay directory, e.g in your home directory and add the following
   to the PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in /etc/make.conf:

   <your-home-dir>/sage-on-gentoo

   Make sure to include the trailing 'sage-on-gentoo' (which does not yet
   exist but will be created by git).

2. Download the repository:
   Go to the overlay directory (if you are following the above example that will
   be your home directory) and type:

     git clone git://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo.git

   (which means you will need dev-util/git). This will create the sage-on-gentoo
   directory.

3. Unmask packages:
   Before installing, you will need to unmask the required packages. A list of
   all required packages is located at:

   sage-on-gentoo/packages.keywords/sage

   Permanent unmasking can be done easily via placing a symbolic link in your
   /etc/portage/package.keywords directory, e.g.:

     ln -s ~/sage-on-gentoo/package.keywords/sage /etc/portage/package.keywords/sage

4. Test the ebuild:
   Type

     emerge -va sage

   to install sage; note that sci-libs/blas-atlas will take its time (on my pc
   about 4 hours). If you intend to test sage I _strongly recommend_ to use
   ccache (FEATURES=ccache, dev-util/ccache) which speeds up subsequent
   compilations.

5. Update repository:
   To update change to the repository (sage-on-gentoo directory) and type:

     git pull

   and reemerge sage with

     emerge sage

   to use the latest ebuild (if you add additional options to emerge make sure
   that sage will get recompiled!).

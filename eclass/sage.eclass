# @BLURB: Tools to ease the compilation of Sage's spkg-packages and Sage itself
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The sage eclass serves two purposes:
# Fistly, it eases the compilation of Sage itself by providing functions for
# patching and modifying its *.spkg-files.
#
# Secondly, in order to install packages from Sage's tarball it provides a
# src_unpack function for automatic unpacking. You must set the following two
# variables to make use of this:
#
# @CODE
# SAGE_VERSION
# SAGE_PACKAGE
# @CODE
# @EXAMPLE:
# The following is a minimal version of the flintqs ebuild and shows the usage
# for packages included in Sage's tarball:
#
# @CODE
# EAPI=2
#
# SAGE_VERSION="4.2.1"
# SAGE_PACKAGE="flintqs-20070817.p4"
#
# inherit eutils sage
#
# [..]
#
# src_prepare() {
# 	cp "${SAGE_FILESDIR}"/lanczos.h .
#
# 	[..]
# }
#
# [..]
# @CODE

# Points to the directory where Sage's files will be placed

# @FUNCTION: hg_clean
# @USAGE: [list of dirs]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Remove Mercurial directories recursiveley.  Useful when a source tarball
# contains internal Mercurial directories.  Defaults to $PWD.
hg_clean() {
    [[ -z $* ]] && set -- .

# @FUNCTION: sage_clean_targets
# @USAGE: [list of makefile targets to clean]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This function clears the prerequisites and commands for the specified targets
# in Sage's deps-makefile. If one wants to use e.g. sqlite from portage, do the
# following:
#
# @CODE
# sage_clean_targets SQLITE
# @CODE
#
# This modifies ${S}/spkg/standard/deps, which contains in sage-4.2.1 the
# following lines:
#
# @CODE
# $(INST)/$(SQLITE): $(INST)/$(TERMCAP) $(INST)/$(READLINE)
#     $(SAGE_SPKG) $(SQLITE) 2>&1
# @CODE
#
# The lines above will now be replaced with:
#
# @CODE
# $(INST)/$(SQLITE):
#     @echo "using SQLITE from portage"
# @CODE
#
# so that ${S}/spkg/standard/deps is still a valid makefile but without building
# sqlite.
sage_clean_targets() {
	for i in "$@"; do
		sed -i -n "
		# look for the makefile-target we need
		/^\\\$(INST)\/\\\$($i)\:.*/ {
			# clear the target's prerequisites and add a simple 'echo'-command
			# that will inform us that this target will not be built
			s//\\\$(INST)\/\\\$($i)\:\n\t@echo \"using $i from portage\"/p
			: label
			# go to the next line without printing the buffer (note that sed is
			# invoked with '-n') ...
			n
			# and check if its empty - if that is the case the target definition
			# is finished.
			/^\$/ {
				# print empty line ...
				p
				# and exit
				b
			}
			# this is not an empty line, so it must be a line containing
			# commands. Since we do not want these to be executed, we simply do
			# not print them and proceed with the next line
